### Get in contact with our teaching assistant

Clearly described problems, thoughtful discussions, appropriate requests like asking for slip days, and useful suggestions are always welcome! Don't hesitate to get in contact with our teaching assistant and he is always reachable via email: **luok7[at]mail2.sysu.edu.cn**. You will be very likely to get bonus by contributing more interactions (though we don't have strict rules for it).

But even if you are uncertain about the quality of your questions, just feel free to send him an email. You won't get a worse result than being asked to re-describe your question again.

If you want, you can also add him to your WeChat contacts (he can be found in the course WeChat group). However, he is reluctant to answer any academia questions via WeChat dialogues since he is too lazy to pick up his phone.
